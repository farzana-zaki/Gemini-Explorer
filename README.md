# Gemini-Explorer

# Project Name: Create a Streamlit Chat Interface integrating Google‚Äôs Advanced LLM, Gemini

## Mission Scenario

Develop a chat interface using Streamlit to integrate with Google's cutting-edge large language model, Gemini. This project aims to provide an accessible platform to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of advanced language model applications. It also aims to serve as an educational and practical introduction to the fusion of large language models and user-friendly interfaces.

## Mission Workflow

Task 1: üåê Enable Google Cloud
Task 2: üß¨ Google Cloud Initialization
Task 3: ‚òÅÔ∏è Setting up Google Gemini
Task 4: üìä Streamlit Integration
Task 5: üó£Ô∏è Adding Initial System Messages
Task 6: üìÑ Preparing Submission

### Task 1: üåê Enabling Google Cloud
#### Steps:
- Create a Google Cloud account. Navigate to https://cloud.google.com/ and sign up for a new account or log in if you already have an account.
- Verify your account by entering the necessary billing information when prompted. Remember, you will not be charged now; it's just for verification purposes.
- Please make sure that your billing information is correct and up-to-date. This is crucial for account verification and access to Google Cloud Platform services.
- Create a new project in your Google Cloud Platform dashboard for the Gemini Explorer Mission. Give your project a unique and descriptive name to make it easy to identify.
- In the Google Cloud Platform console, go to the Vertex AI section and enable the recommended APIs for your project to utilize Vertex AI's capabilities fully.

### Task 2: üß¨ Google Cloud Initialization
üõ†Ô∏è Dive into backend development with these steps! Clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, start the FastAPI server and test endpoints.
#### Google Cloud CLI: [1]
Google Cloud Command Line Interface (gcloud CLI) lets you manage resources and services from the command line. It also contains service and data emulators to speed up local development.
For example, you can use the gcloud CLI to create and manage the following:
- Compute Engine virtual machine instances and other resources
- Cloud SQL instances
- Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
- Dataproc clusters and jobs
- Cloud DNS managed zones and record sets
- Cloud Deployment Manager deployments

#### Steps:
- Install Google Cloud SDK: Visit the Google Cloud SDK webpage and download the installer for your operating system (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- Initialize Google Cloud SDK by opening the command prompt and running the following command to start the initialization process: >gcloud init
- Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Google Cloud account and set up your default project and configuration.
- Set No to compute region and zone (Optional Step)
- If you encounter authentication problems, use the following command to authenticate using your Google account: gcloud auth application-default login. This command will open a browser window for you to log in and 
  will help avoid the need to expose API keys.

### Task 3: ‚òÅÔ∏è Setting up Google Gemini (Windows)
üöÄ Dive into generative models effortlessly! Import necessary libraries like Vertexai and Streamlit, then set up your project, initialize the model, and troubleshoot potential issues.

#### Steps:
To create a virtual environment, download the required libraries, and run a Python script in VS Code, you can follow these steps:
##### Step 1: Open a folder named ‚ÄúGemini_Explorer‚Äù on your computer.
##### Step 2: Create a txt file named requirements.txt and write the following things inside the txt file:
	streamlit
	google-cloud-aiplatform
	vertexai
##### Step 3: Open VS code>new python file>write necessary python codes and save it as gemini-explorer.py
- Write your Python script in VS Code. Use the project name (that was created on the GCP platform, Task-1) in the project; for example, my project name was Gemini-explorer-423520, so I used project = "Gemini-explorer-423520". This helps avoid encountering a 403 permission denied error.
- Ensure that the correct interpreter is selected for your created virtual environment. You can do this by clicking on the interpreter version displayed in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window and selecting the interpreter associated with your virtual environment (shift+ctrl+P and then selecting the Python version installed on your local machine).

##### Step 4: To run the code, use the VS terminal and follow the following steps:
- Use cd c:\Folder_name to navigate to the ‚ÄúGemini_Explorer folder‚Äù
- Create a virtual environment (‚Äúenv‚Äù) sub-folder inside the ‚ÄúGemini_Explorer‚Äù folder by writing the following in the VS code terminal:
	                   python -m venv env
- After creating the virtual environment, activate the virtual environment (env) by writing the following in the VS code terminal:
                    - For windows:	env\Scripts\activate
                    - For macOS and Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

- Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries from the requirements.txt by writing the following in the VS code terminal:
                                     pip install -r requirements.txt
- Download Google Cloud SDK inside the ‚ÄúGemini_Explorer‚Äù folder and authenticate the Google Cloud by writing the following in the VS code terminal:
	                                   Gcloud auth application-default login
   and select your email and allow Google to authenticate the Google cloud.
- Run the Python code by writing the following in the VS code terminal:
                    .\gemini-explorer.py

 
Following these steps, you can create a virtual environment, download the required libraries, and run a Python script in VS Code.

### Task 4:üìä Streamlit Integration
üì≤ Streamlit-powered Gemini Explorer! Define a chat function, set up the Streamlit interface, display and load chat history, and capture user input effortlessly.
#### Step: Run the following command in the VS code terminal to view the RadicalX Gemini Explorer chatbot in the streamlit :
                              streamlit run gemini-explorer.py
Make sure you follow every step of Task 3 before this step.

### Task 5:üó£Ô∏è Adding Initial System Messages
üöÄ Enhance ReX's personality in your Streamlit app! Implement logic for the initial prompt, experiment with different styles, and personalize ReX with user information for engaging interactions.
