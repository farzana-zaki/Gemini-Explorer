# Gemini-Explorer

# Project Name: Create a Streamlit Chat Interface integrating Google’s Advanced LLM, Gemini

## Mission Scenario

Develop a chat interface using Streamlit to integrate with Google's cutting-edge large language model, Gemini. This project aims to provide an accessible platform to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of advanced language model applications. It also aims to serve as an educational and practical introduction to the fusion of large language models and user-friendly interfaces.

## Mission Workflow

Task 1: 🌐 Enable Google Cloud
Task 2: 🧬 Google Cloud Initialization
Task 3: ☁️ Setting up Google Gemini
Task 4: 📊 Streamlit Integration
Task 5: 🗣️ Adding Initial System Messages
Task 6: 📄 Preparing Submission

### Task 1: 🌐 Enabling Google Cloud
#### Steps:
- Create a Google Cloud account. Navigate to https://cloud.google.com/ and sign up for a new account or log in if you already have an account.
- Verify your account by entering the necessary billing information when prompted. Remember, you will not be charged now; it's just for verification purposes.
- Please make sure that your billing information is correct and up-to-date. This is crucial for account verification and access to Google Cloud Platform services.
- Create a new project in your Google Cloud Platform dashboard for the Gemini Explorer Mission. Give your project a unique and descriptive name to make it easy to identify.
- In the Google Cloud Platform console, go to the Vertex AI section and enable the recommended APIs for your project to utilize Vertex AI's capabilities fully.

### Task 2: 🧬 Google Cloud Initialization
🛠️ Dive into backend development with these steps! Clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, start the FastAPI server and test endpoints.
#### Steps:
- Install Google Cloud SDK: Visit the Google Cloud SDK webpage and download the installer for your operating system (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- Initialize Google Cloud SDK by opening the command prompt and run the following command to start the initialization process: gcloud init
- Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Google Cloud account and set up your default project and configuration.
- Set No to compute region and zone (Optional Step)
- If you encounter authentication problems, use the following command to authenticate using your Google account: gcloud auth application-default login. This command will open a browser window for you to log in and 
  will help avoid the need to expose API keys.
